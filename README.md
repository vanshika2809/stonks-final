# Stonks Frontend Assignment

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project is a frontend assignment built using Next.js. It includes a data table with pagination, filtering, and sorting capabilities using @tanstack/react-table. Users can upload and compress images using react-dropzone and browser-image-compression. The user data is fetched from a mock API using axios, and the project demonstrates effective use of custom hooks, state management, and responsive design principles.
